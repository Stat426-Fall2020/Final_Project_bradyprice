# Machine Learning Final Project - Predicting MLB Player's Positions

### Question to answer: Using the statistics of MLB players every season (To qualify, a player must have 3.1 PA per team game played), can we predict their position that they play?

 - ## Process

### I used the data on MLB's stats website and pulled in each year from 1990-2020 and the statistics of each player. Using that information, I was able to create a Random Forest model that predicts the position that player plays.
